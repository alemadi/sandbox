> ⚠️ **THIS IS A SANDBOX FORK — NOT PRODUCTION.**
> Everything below this banner is inherited history from `qnb-staff-wc2026`.
> This copy is for local R&D only and must never be pushed to the production repo,
> its `main`, or `staffchallenge26.com`. See `SANDBOX_README.md`.

## 2026-06-13 10:24 (Doha) — Sandbox fork created (local-only; no prod impact)
**Pushed:** (not pushed — local sandbox scaffold)
**Changed:**
- Blanked `SUPABASE_URL` (index.html ~line 1011) → `CONFIGURED===false` → app runs local-only; no backend write can fire.
- Replaced `SUPABASE_KEY` with `"SANDBOX_LOCAL_ONLY"` placeholder (prod anon key removed from this copy).
- Deleted `CNAME` (was `staffchallenge26.com`) so this repo cannot claim the production domain.
- `manifest.json` renamed to "Staff Challenge — SANDBOX"; `start_url`/`scope` made relative.
- Added `SANDBOX_README.md`.

**Rollback (git):** n/a — sandbox was never pushed. To discard, delete the sandbox folder/repo.
**Rollback (DB):** n/a — no database was touched (local-only, no Supabase project attached).

## 2026-06-13 04:55 (Doha) — Fix: robot couldn't confirm m3 (ESPN name "Bosnia-Herzegovina" unaliased)

**Commits:** `8d8802f` (sql/robot.sql + changelog) and a follow-up SHA-correction commit (this one).

**What changed:**
- ESPN's scoreboard names last night's m3 opponent **"Bosnia-Herzegovina"** (hyphen, no "and"), which normalizes to `bosniaherzegovina`. The alias table only had `bosniaandherzegovina`, and the fixture name "Bosnia & H." normalizes to `bosniah`, so `wc_ourname()` returned null and the robot's both-names-or-nothing guard skipped the match every tick. Cron, fetches (all 200 OK), and m1/m2 confirms were healthy throughout.
- Added alias row `('bosniaherzegovina','Bosnia & H.')` to `wc_alias` — applied live in Supabase at 04:51 Doha and mirrored into `sql/robot.sql` here.
- Ran `wc_autoconfirm_tick()` once manually after the insert: it confirmed **m3 = Canada 1–1 Bosnia & H.** from the already-fetched payload (`confirmed 1 · snapshot 2026-06-13→2026-06-13 · next fetch: yes`). No manual `wc:results` write — the robot wrote it through its normal path, organizer supremacy untouched.

**DB applied (live):**

    insert into wc_alias(espn, ours) values ('bosniaherzegovina', 'Bosnia & H.')
    on conflict (espn) do nothing;

**Rollback (git):**

**Rollback (DB):**

    delete from wc_alias where espn = 'bosniaherzegovina';
    -- and to undo the m3 confirm itself (only if genuinely wrong):
    -- update kv set value = (value::jsonb - 'm3')::text, updated_at = now() where key = 'wc:results';

**kv snapshot before robot wrote m3** (`wc:results`, updated 2026-06-12 08:00 Doha):

## 2026-06-12 19:12 (Doha) — Fix: countdown header jitter (flag imgs rebuilt every second)

**Commits:** `6ceb352` (app) + this changelog commit.

**What changed** (frontend only, `index.html`):
- `tickCountdown()` runs every 1s. It was rebuilding the whole "Next kickoff" label — the two flag `<img>`s included — on every tick, not just the clock digits. Benign until today's `cca580c` set `.fl-img` to `width:auto;height:13px`: a just-recreated `<img>` has zero width until it decodes, so the header snapped narrower→wider once per second (the visible jitter).
- The match label now re-renders only when its text actually changes (next match rolls over, or KO teams resolve); the day/hr/min/sec digits keep updating every tick as before.
- Side benefit: ~86,400 fewer redundant DOM rebuilds per open tab per day.
- Verified headless (jsdom): the flag `<img>` node is the same across four consecutive ticks; clock still renders all four units; swipe deck smoke test unaffected.

**DB:** none. No kv writes, no SQL, `wc:results` untouched.

**Rollback (git):**

## 2026-06-12 18:43 (Doha) — Swipe deck: score-at-end (removes the blocking +2 interstitial)

**Commits:** `f81f4f4` (app) + this changelog commit. Rebased atop the stats wave (`f54ee51`) after a push race.

**What changed** (frontend only, `index.html`; supersedes the swipe +2 step from `e8f2729`):
- Group-match swipes flow straight to the next card — the full-screen "Exact score? +2" step between every swipe is removed (functions, CSS, keyboard guard, `SW.step`), not bypassed.
- The "All caught up" screen becomes a one-tap fine-tune pass when any of the session's group picks still lack an exact score: one row per match with the same score chips; rows mark green when armed; Done closes. Classic done screen when nothing needs scoring.
- Scores save through the existing `chipPick` → `queueSave` path (main-list chips stay in sync); kickoff-locked matches are excluded from the fine-tune list. KO swipes and skip behaviour unchanged.
- Verified headless (jsdom) post-rebase: 70-card deck swiped end-to-end, zero interstitials; fine-tune rows = group picks; chip tap sets score + outcome, `sel` moves on re-tap. Direction chosen by owner from a three-mode interactive feel test.

**DB:** none. No kv writes, no SQL, `wc:results` untouched.

**Rollback (git):**

## 2026-06-12 18:20 — Stats wave: clearer consensus, exact-score lines, finale office stats, champion map

**Commits:** `f54ee51` (app) + this changelog commit.

**What changed** (frontend only, `index.html`; rebased atop the pick-reward layer `8e16fbb`):
- Consensus line rewritten for clarity — it read like betting odds. Now: "🏟 13 colleagues called it: Mexico 31% (you) · Draw 46% · South Africa 23%" — headcount leads, names before percentages, your pick marked "(you)". Knockout cards match.
- Exact-score line beneath it: finished matches show "🎯 You + 2 others nailed 2–1" / "Only you nailed 2–1" / "N colleagues nailed it" / "Nobody nailed 1–1"; locked-but-unplayed matches show "🎯 Top score pick: 1–0 (3)" (shown from 3 picks).
- Reveal finale now ends with up to two office lines: biggest office miss (shown when ≤45% got it right), longest active streak (≥3), perfect-day count.
- Champion card auto-upgrades at champion lock (Thu 18 Jun, 19:00 Doha): the lock-in count becomes "🏆 Office champions: 🇧🇷 Brazil 42% · 🇦🇷 Argentina 33% · 🇫🇷 France 17%" (top 3, flags). Gated on `locked(CHAMP_LOCK)` via the synced server clock — Thursday needs no deploy.
- Aggregation extended inside the same consensus pass: exact-score counts, champion distribution, per-player streaks and perfect days. Still read-only, cached 10 min, locked-matches-only, hidden in demo.

**DB:** none. No kv writes, no SQL.

**Rollback:** `git revert f54ee51 && git push origin main` — pure frontend.

## 2026-06-12 17:55 (Doha) — PIN prompt: close the deck, keep pre-PIN picks, welcome-back prefill

**Commits:** `26236f0` (app) + this changelog commit.

**What changed** (frontend only, `index.html`; applies atop UX wave 1 `e8f2729`):
- `needPin()` now closes the swipe deck (if open) before `go("join")`. The PIN re-prompt — which every device hits once after Anti-cheat Phase 1 — used to fire behind the overlay, leaving players swiping picks that never saved.
- `needPin()` prefills the handle and dispatches `input` so the welcome-back flow fires (note + "Resume my game"), plus instant name/dept/country prefill from the live session — the forced re-claim is one field, and dept/country aren't blanked or reset to Qatar.
- `joinNow()` merges in-memory predictions (+ champ) over the server copy when re-claiming the active session's own slug, so picks made before entering the PIN are no longer dropped. Never merges when claiming a different handle; kickoff locks remain server-enforced.

**DB:** none. No kv writes, no SQL, `wc:results` untouched.

**Rollback (git):**

    git revert 26236f0
    git push https://x-access-token:<TOKEN>@github.com/alemadi/qnb-staff-wc2026.git main

**Rollback (DB):** n/a.

## 2026-06-12 17:41 — UX wave 1: link cards, slim sticky bar, office consensus, swipe +2 step, welcome-back

**Commits:** `e8f2729` (app + og.png) + this changelog commit.

**What changed** (frontend only, `index.html` + new `og.png`; rebased atop anti-cheat Phase 1 `4f5ed8f`):
- OG/Twitter meta + new `og.png` (1200×630) — shared links now unfurl properly in WhatsApp/Teams.
- Header fits at 390px when signed in (WORLD CUP 26 column hides ≤439px once the user chip shows).
- Sticky progress panel collapses to a slim one-row bar on scroll, seated below the filter chips; the points table auto-closes when it shrinks.
- Swipe mode: each group-match swipe now offers an optional exact-score step that arms the +2 bonus (skippable; arrows skip; KO swipes unchanged). Swipe-card date uses the short format so it no longer wraps.
- Office consensus on locked/finished cards plus a line in the reveal ritual ("Only 23% of the office called this — sharp."). Client-side aggregate of player rows, cached 10 min, displayed for locked matches only, hidden in demo. Future optimisation: robot-written `wc:consensus` key.
- Champion card shows "N colleagues have locked their champion" once N ≥ 10.
- Join: typing an existing handle shows a welcome-back note, prefills dept/country, and the CTA becomes "Resume my game"; department is no longer re-required for returning players (kept from their row). Sign-out copy says "handle", not "email".
- Reveal: the verdict stamp sits below the result text — no more overlap at 390px.
- Leaderboard: viewable signed-out with a join CTA; Matches/Me bounce visitors to join with a toast; the pinned rival is tagged 🎯 in the list.
- Me: new computed badges — 🔥 streak ≥3, 💎 perfect day, 🃏 maverick (won a pick ≤25% of the office shared), 🇶🇦 all-in on Qatar — capped at 5 shown.
- Live-feed guard: ESPN live/finished scores render only once the match is locked by server clock, so picks can never sit open next to a live score.
- A11y: aria-labels on all pick buttons and score inputs; score chips grown to a comfortable tap size.
- MALDIVES departures flaps fit one line at 390px.

**DB:** none. No kv writes, no SQL — consensus is read-only `sbulkJSON` over world-readable rows.

**Rollback:** `git revert e8f2729 && git push origin main` — pure frontend + one static asset.

## 2026-06-12 17:05 (Doha) — Anti-cheat Phase 1: APPLIED to production + promoted

**Pushed:** `25b2d13` fast-forwarded onto `main` (from `a98a477`), plus this addendum commit.

**What happened (all times Doha, 12 Jun 2026):**

- **16:57** — full `kv` snapshot taken via Management API *before* any change
  (376 rows; `wc:results` value md5 `086a066c2c97be71ecda0f586c480d30`). Snapshot
  retained off-repo by the operator (contains pre-migration PIN hashes — must
  never enter this public repo). Satisfies the snapshot-before-overwrite rule.
- **16:57** — `sql/protect.sql` exactly as committed in `4f5ed8f` applied to the
  production database in a single atomic batch (Supabase Management API).
- **Verified in-DB:** `wc_locks` = 105 · `wc_auth` = 374 (= player rows) ·
  player rows still carrying `"pin"` = 0 · kv rows = 376 (unchanged) ·
  `wc:results` byte-identical to snapshot · anon privileges on `kv` reduced to
  SELECT only · robot cron `wc-autoconfirm` (*/10) still active.
- **Verified outside-in (publishable key):** `org_check` → 200 `false` ·
  direct `kv` write → `42501 permission denied` · public reads → 200 ·
  `save_picks` reachable and rejecting bad input (`bad_slug`), no write.
- **17:01** — `main` promoted `a98a477..25b2d13`; hardened client confirmed
  live on staffchallenge26.com (cache-busted) at **17:00:47**. Old-client
  write gap: ≈ 3 minutes. Players mid-session on the old client must reload
  once to regain saving.
- **Observed, pre-existing, left as-is:** `kv` already had RLS enabled with
  legacy wide-open policies `r`/`i`/`u`/`d` (PUBLIC) and full anon table grants
  incl. TRUNCATE. Writes are blocked by the privilege revoke regardless;
  the open `i`/`u`/`d` policies are now dead weight. **Follow-up:** add
  `drop policy if exists` for them to `protect.sql` via the normal
  prove-locally-first flow.

**Rollback:** unchanged — see the 16:27 entry below (`git revert 4f5ed8f` +
`sql/rollback.sql`). The operator-held snapshot can additionally restore
`wc:results` (or any key) verbatim if ever needed.

## 2026-06-12 16:27 — Anti-cheat Phase 1: server-side enforcement (RLS + RPCs)

**Commits:** `4f5ed8f` (app + SQL) + this changelog commit.
_(SHA filled at commit time — see "Deploy order" below; nothing is live until the SQL is run in Supabase.)_

**Why:** every rule (pick locks, result entry, identity) was enforced in the
browser only. With the publishable key, anyone could `curl` the kv table to
edit picks after kickoff, forge results, read/overwrite rivals, or delete
entries. Proven end-to-end in `proof/` (all four work pre-change, all blocked
after).

**What changed**

- **`sql/protect.sql`** (new — run once in Supabase, after `robot.sql`):
  - `wc_locks` (105 rows: m1–m72, k1–k32, `_champ`) — when each pick seals,
    generated from the client's own FIXTURES.
  - `wc_auth` (private) — PIN hashes migrated out of player rows; the `pin`
    key is stripped from every `wc:player:*` row.
  - `wc_org_auth` (private) — seeded with the existing shipped organizer hash,
    so the current access code keeps working. Rotate:
    `update wc_org_auth set code_hash = wc_pin_hash('NEW CODE')`.
  - `save_picks(slug,pin,payload)` — the ONLY player write path. Verifies PIN
    in SQL (wrong PIN → 0.3 s nap), keeps the stored value for any match whose
    kickoff has passed (server clock), sanitizes every field, never stores the
    PIN. Returns the canonical row for the client to reconcile.
  - `org_check` / `org_exec` — organizer reads/writes gated by the code in SQL
    (wrong code → 0.4 s nap); writes limited to `wc:results`, `wc:kteams`,
    `wc:player:*`, plus `clearpin`.
  - **The wall:** RLS on `kv` (world-readable, zero direct writes from
    anon/authenticated); auth/locks/robot tables revoked from the API roles.
  - The ESPN robot is unaffected — it runs as the table owner (SECURITY
    DEFINER), so it still confirms group results and still never overwrites the
    organizer. Verified in `proof/30_robot.sql`.
- **`index.html`** (frontend, 85 ins / 32 del): all shared-state writes now go
  through the RPCs. Removed the shipped organizer hash. Device PIN stored
  locally (`wc:pin`); organizer code held in memory only (relocks on reload).
  `persistPlayer`→`savePicksRPC` + `reconcilePicks`; all organizer writes →
  `orgSet`/`orgDel`. No remaining direct writes to shared keys (grep-verified).
- **`sql/rollback.sql`** (new) — exact inverse (see below).
- **`proof/`** (new) — a local Postgres harness that recreates the live shape,
  runs the four cheats before/after, exercises every legit path, and runs the
  robot's two-tick ESPN cycle. `proof/run_all.sh` reproduces it from a clean DB;
  `proof/PROOF_RUN.log` is the captured run.

**DB:** **YES — live change.** Run `sql/protect.sql` once. It is idempotent and
the PIN migration is one-time. **Before running, snapshot the current value of
`wc:results`** (copy the row out of the SQL editor) per project rule.

**Deploy order:** (1) snapshot `wc:results`; (2) run `sql/protect.sql` in
Supabase; (3) push the `index.html` commit. Running the SQL first means the old
client keeps working in the gap (reads are unaffected; the old client's direct
writes simply start failing, which is the point) — but keep the gap short.

**Rollback (exact, executable):**
1. `git revert 4f5ed8f && git push origin main` — restores the old
   client (which reads the PIN from the player row).
2. Run **`sql/rollback.sql`** in Supabase — it restores PIN hashes into the
   player rows, drops the RLS policy, `disable row level security` on `kv`,
   re-grants insert/update/delete on `kv` to anon/authenticated, drops
   `save_picks`/`org_check`/`org_exec`/`wc_pin_hash` and the `wc_auth`/
   `wc_org_auth`/`wc_locks` tables (keeps `server_time()`, which predates this
   push). Round-trip (protect → rollback → protect) verified clean in the proof.
3. If a manual `wc:results` edit was made after hardening, restore the
   pre-change snapshot from step (1) of Deploy order.

## 2026-06-12 12:04 — Swipe discoverability · honest exits · Matches header decluttered

**Commits:** `a576e35` (app) + this changelog commit.

**What changed** (frontend only, `index.html`):
- Removed the "Where to watch in Doha" row from Matches, plus its 4 orphaned CSS rules. Watch keeps the bottom-nav tab, the live pulsebar, and the footer link.
- Quick-pick entry renamed **"⚡ Swipe to pick · N left"**; dialog aria-label matches.
- First card of every deck open **rocks** (±22px / ±3.4°, 0.4s after deal-in) to show it's draggable; grabbing cancels it; once per open; off under reduced-motion.
- The shared ✕ is now a **42px glass circle, top-right**, in all three overlays (quick-pick, reveal ritual, FAQ); skip moved left; FAQ spacer 34→42px keeps the title centered.
- **Grabber + drag-down-to-close** on all three overlays (`armSheet`): header-scoped, 90px threshold, spring-back under, buttons excluded.

**DB:** none. No kv writes, no SQL, `wc:results` untouched.

**Rollback:** `git revert a576e35 && git push origin main` — pure frontend, nothing else to undo.

## 2026-06-12 18:06 — Uniform-height flags in pick buttons & chips

**Commits:** `cca580c` (app) + this changelog commit.

**What changed** (frontend only, `index.html` — 3 CSS lines):
- `.mini .fl-img` (flags inside pick buttons): was width-scaled to 24px with a `vertical-align:-5px` hack, so flags with extreme official ratios looked mismatched (Qatar 24×10 sliver vs Switzerland 24×24 square) and sat below center. Now `height:17px; width:auto; display:block` — uniform height, true proportions, flex-centered.
- `.fl-img` base (inline flags: Qatar filter chip, locked-champion line): same fix at `height:13px; width:auto`.
- `.flag .fl-img` (big team-card flags): unchanged visually, but gained an explicit `height:auto` so the new height-based base rule cannot squash it. `.sw-t .fl-img` (swipe deck) already had its own `height:auto` — untouched.

**DB:** none. No kv writes, no SQL, `wc:results` untouched.

**Rollback:** `git revert cca580c && git push origin main` — pure frontend, nothing else to undo.


## 2026-06-12 18:17 (Doha) — Pick reward layer: pop+glow, stakes float, completion confetti

**Commits:** `8e16fbb` (app) + this changelog commit.

**What changed** (frontend only, `index.html`; additive, all new JS guarded in try/catch):
- Selected pick pops with a springy scale + expanding gold glow ring (`.pick.pop`). Fires on every choose path: H/D/A taps, knockout winner taps, quick-score chips (`chipPick`), typed scores (`saveScore`).
- A "+N on the line" float rises off the chosen pick showing real stakes: `+3` group outcome, `+5 ⚡` once the exact-score bonus is armed, `koPts(m)` for knockouts (`+4` R32 … `+10` final) via the fixture `kn` flag.
- Completion celebration: confetti burst (gold + tricolor, self-removing canvas) + `#pred-bar` glow + toast "🎉 All picks locked in · N/N". Fires only on the transition `_lastPredC < tot → c === tot` inside `syncProgress()` — no retro-fire on boot for already-complete players; re-arms whenever `predTotal()` grows (new KO round unlocking).
- Haptics deliberately unchanged (`vibrate(8)` as-is — stronger haptics considered and declined). `prefers-reduced-motion` respected: CSS via the existing global override, confetti via a JS matchMedia gate.

**DB:** none. No kv writes, no SQL, `wc:results` untouched. **kv snapshot:** n/a — no kv overwrite.

## 2026-06-12 20:13 (Doha)
**Pushed:** 188bed0 (+ this ops commit) — **staging branch only, production main untouched**
**Changed:** Exact-score chips on match cards now follow the result pick (outcome-keyed sets, same as the swipe fine-tune pass) with a 3-chip starter set before a result is chosen. Switching result clears a contradictory stored score (toast shown); complete custom scores always derive the result; `syncChips` removed in favor of `rerenderChips`. No DB/kv change.

**Pushed:** 37352ed (+ this ops commit) — **staging branch only, production main untouched**
**Changed:** Player avatars switched from the uniform beige monogram to deterministic Komposition badges — one circle, one rotated bar, one gold accent dot, generated from the name/slug with the initial overlaid. Applied centrally to all five avatar sites (leaderboard rows, podium, profile, top chip, rival watch) via a new `avatarFill(name)` helper; `.avatar` CSS now hosts the SVG behind a light initial. Derived per-name — no kv/DB field added, `standings()` and the robot untouched. Frontend only.

## 2026-06-12 20:45 (Doha)
**Pushed:** 7c8a488 (+ this ops commit) — **staging branch only, production main untouched**
**Changed:** The Departments leaderboard now uses a dedicated department badge (new `deptAvatarFill`) instead of the people Komposition badge — a rounded-square plaque (vs the circular people avatar) with a Bauhaus quarter-disc, a three-dot "group" glyph, and the department initials; new `.avatar.deptbadge` CSS gives it the square corners. Deterministic from the department name, same jewel palette. People avatars (leaderboard rows, podium, profile, chip) unchanged. Frontend only — no kv/DB change, robot untouched. Builds on the 20:35 Komposition entry.

## 2026-06-12 20:52 (Doha)
**Pushed:** 1c404df (+ this ops commit) — **staging branch only, production main untouched**
**Changed:** Department badges now show a pictogram of the function each department serves (keyword-matched in new `DEPT_ICONS`/`deptIconKey`): Retail Banking → bank, Group Risk → shield, Group Communications → megaphone, Corporate & Institutional Banking → building, Group Human Capital → people, Group Information Technology → chip, Group Treasury → chart, Group Finance → coins, Group Operations → gear, Asset & Wealth Management → gem, Group Compliance → scales; legacy/demo values mapped (Internal Comms → paper plane, VML/agency → bulb, Executive Office → star); Other/unknown → group-of-people fallback. Rounded-square jewel plaque retained; initials removed from dept badges. Supersedes the 20:45 abstract-plaque visual. Frontend only — no kv/DB change, robot untouched.

**Pushed:** 37352ed, 7c8a488, 1c404df (+ staging ops commits 462078f, eb235df, f96f260, + this ops commit) — **to main (production)**
**Changed:** Promoted the avatar overhaul from staging after owner go-ahead. People avatars (leaderboard rows, podium, profile, top chip) are deterministic Komposition badges (circle + bar + gold dot, jewel palette, initial overlaid). Department rows render rounded-square plaques carrying a pictogram of each department's function (bank/shield/megaphone/building/people/chip/chart/coins/gear/gem/scales; legacy values mapped; group-of-people fallback). Frontend only — no kv/DB change, robot untouched.
**§8 gate:** automated headless walk (Playwright/Chromium against the live backend): fresh boot, returning-player boot (real slug, read-only), People↔Departments both directions, demo on/off, Me view, share fallback, rival picker populate — 11/11 passed, zero console errors both sessions. Pick-save and rival-commit not exercised (would write production kv); those code paths are untouched by these commits.

**Pushed:** 6bab9cb (app) + the changelog commit that follows it
**Changed:** Fun-stats sprinkle (UX wave 3): rotating fun-stat ticker under the leaderboard podium (biggest climber / exact-score king / sharpest department / hot hand / upset hunter); personal fun stats on the Me tab (signature scoreline, most-backed team, office-agreement/maverick line); "🧨 Upset — only N% saw it coming" on confirmed match cards; reveal finale gains 💔 heartbreak and 🏢 dept-of-the-day lines (cap 2→3). consensus() gains a second pass (CONS.bestUpset, CONS.deptByDay). No new queries; demo mode unaffected; no DB/robot/kv change.

**Pushed:** 8d250a4, 0aa75c4
**Changed:** Live and locked group-match cards now show the player's exact score pick, e.g. "LIVE · Picked: Canada (2–1)". Previously the (h–a) was only shown after full time. One-line change in matchCard() in index.html. No DB change.

**Pushed:** 3dad395, fca6dac
**Changed:** (1) Sticky progress panel: fixed the collapse/expand jitter at the scroll boundary (overflow-anchor:none on #view-matches breaks the scroll-anchoring feedback loop) and made the mini transition smooth — Swipe-to-pick button and panel now animate width/padding/font/radius over .18s; observer guarded against redundant toggles. (2) Champion pick lifecycle: full card only while unpicked; collapses to a slim tap-to-change chip once picked; after the 18 Jun lock it leaves the Matches feed (trophy+flag token in the sticky bar links to Me, new champion line on the Me card, +25 nudge for players with no pick); payoff banner returns to Matches after the final. ?champlock URL param previews the locked state. Frontend only — no DB/robot/kv change.

**Pushed:** 0b75da8
**Changed:** Champion card/chip relocated above the sticky Predictions panel at the top of Matches (was below it). Placed above the #prog-sent sentinel so the mini-collapse trigger timing is unchanged; .champ gains 11px bottom margin. Lifecycle from fca6dac unchanged. Frontend only — no DB/robot/kv change.

**Pushed:** 660a7f4 (app) + the changelog commit that follows it
**Changed:** Fun-stats wave 4: pick twin + hit-rate-vs-office on the Me tab; photo-finish / N-way-tie and still-perfect facts in the leaderboard ticker; top-scorer-of-the-day (👑 when it's you) and office day hit-rate in the reveal finale (line cap 3→4); one gold fun-stat line on the share card (shareFunLine). consensus() gains officeHit, perfectN, dayHit, dayTop, twin. Rebased onto 8d250a4 with the live/locked exact-score hotfix preserved. No new queries; demo mode unaffected; no DB/robot/kv change.

**Pushed:** c87f11b, plus this ops commit
**Changed:** Completed-match treatment in the Matches view. Finished matches render as
receipt cards (final score, dashed rule, your call + points); finished matches from
previous days collapse into one-line "Completed · day" rows at the bottom of the round
view, tap-to-expand. Group + knockout supported. Frontend only — no DB/robot change.
